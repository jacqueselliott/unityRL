Things to try at the moment
Train on discrete sim - DONE
Train on continous sim - DONE
Train on discrete with the new reward function - in progress
Train with larger temporal window

Future work
3D discrete - 10x10x10
Add more targets/obstacles to the game, see what policy it learns
Implement actor critic and try this on any of the above
Get system working end to end - SpatialOS/Unity <-> Imran Server <-> Neural network
Larger 2D game?
