Things to try at the moment
Train on continuous sim with fixed network
Train on discrete sim
Train with larger temporal window
Try reducing tau?

Future work
Add  more targets to the game, see what policy it learns
Use pre-trained net on multi-sphere game/train new net on multisphere game - this can be continuous/discrete
Use pre-trained net on larger game and see what happens - continuous/discrete
Get system working end to end - SpatialOS/Unity <-> Imran Server <-> Neural network
Implement actor critic and try this on any of the above
